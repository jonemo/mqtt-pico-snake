MQTT Snake
==========

This code was used for a live demo during a presentation at Pycon 
US 2023 in Salt Lake City. It contains a Snake game variant that
publishes its current score and subscribes to scores from other 
players. 

The software is written for Micropython running on a Raspberry Pi
Pico W controller with a Waveshare Pico-LCD-1.14 screen.
